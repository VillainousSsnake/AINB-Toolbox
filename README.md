# AINB-Toolbox
This is an all-in-one app for AINB files. Part of 0x1de NX, to learn more go here: https://discord.gg/GA5qfJ53bK

I used a modified version of dt-12345's AINB library, so here is a link to his GitHub account: https://github.com/dt-12345

## Latest release: (0.3.0)

## Features
- ***AINB File Editor (JSON)***: This opens an AINB file like a JSON file, and then when it is time to save/export, it reserializes the file as an AINB file.
- ***AINB File Editor (YAML)***: This does the same thing as the AINB as JSON editor, but instead of the JSON format, it's the YAML format.
- ***AINB File Extractor***: This extracts all the AINB files from a RomFS game dump of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and writes them all into one folder. This is mainly just a quality-of-life feature and it makes it convenient to search for AINB files in File Explorer.

## Planned Features
- *AINB File Converter*: This will convert AINB files to JSON and YAML, and vice versa.
- *AINB File Editor (NODE-LIKE)*: This will edit AINB files through a more user-friendly UI and it will use the JSON code to create boxes of nodes and commands so that you can add, delete, or create them.
